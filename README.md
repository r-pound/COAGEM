Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Gas Exchange Model

A box model that couples the dry deposition of atmospheric trace gasses to the ocean surface microlayer (SML) with chemistry in the SML, mixing between the surface and bulk ocean and emission of species from the SML to the atmosphere. 

This version of the model is described by (Paper pending submission). It is currently configured for the dry deposition of ozone, inorganic halogen chemistry and the emission of inorganic iodine species. The methods employed in this model however should be applicable to other species with relatively few changes
